### About Me

- 📍 I am in the BSc Computer Science program at Mount Royal University in Calgary, AB.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a basic shell program to learn more about the Linux O/S.
- 🔭 I've recently worked with a partner on a low-level videogame engine for the Atari ST, which we used to develop a rhythm game. 
- 🎮 In my free time I like to write and play music, play retro games, watch Formula 1 and other motorsports with friends, and go for nature walks.
