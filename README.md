### About Me
Hi, my name is Andrew Boisvert. I am a BSc Computer Science student at Mount Royal University in Calgary, AB.

I am very interested in low-level programming and game design, but I've found myself enjoying working with the wide variety of technology I've been fortunate to have been exposed to. 

### Some Things About Me

- 📍 I am in the BSc Computer Science program at Mount Royal University in Calgary, AB
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and Motorola MC68K assembly for low-level programming.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a low-level videogame engine for the Atari ST which I am using to develop a rhythm/music game. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on student projects and I'm open to any sort of ideas or proposals. 
- 🎮 In my free time I like to write and play music, play retro games, watch Formula 1 and other motorsports with friends, and go for nature walks. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I would have never guess I would study computer science as a child, but I've found a great passion towards it. I was let into an "advanced class" where kids could learn about computers around Grade 3 (around the year 2000). We were making basic websites with HTML and CSS and I was so disinterested I stopped it almost immediately. I thought I just wasn't that interested in computers, but it turned out I just didn't like HTML and CSS when I was 8.
